## Disney Logo

The image above is the legendary logo of one of the biggest names of animation. "Disney" as it is called is easily one of the best animation studios in the world. They have made countless big titles like,Moana, Donald Duck and other names like the Little Mermaid.Of course there are other competitors like, Pixar and DreamWorks.


## Disney Movies

I myself like animations therefore that is why Disney is one of my favorite topics to talk about.There are so much effort put into these movies. Especially back in the 1900´s because back then they did not have technology as good as we do now so what they did was draw on a big piece of sketch paper and then color it and then repeat the action to make a animation.


## Why Disney Animation is the Best

Some people will agree and some don't agree but Disney has been everywhere through my life and that is one of the reasons why it is the best. Another reason to why it is the best in my opinion is due to the fact that they still make animations till today. This shows that Disney cares for their audience. Some people are going to disagree with me and say "they're just making animations because they need the money for their business, so they don´t care for the audience, they just want money"

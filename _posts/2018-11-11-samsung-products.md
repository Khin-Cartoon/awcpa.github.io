## What Samsung is
Samsung is one of the biggest companies that produce technical products for a living. One of their most succesful products that they have sold is the Samsung Galaxy, the Samsung Galaxy is a type of phone that they make and trust me, their latest Galaxy (Galaxy S9) is a monster with speed and and the display of the thing is just amazing! I highly reccomend a Samsung Galaxy S9 but if you dont want to pay 1k for a phone, just buy one of their old ones like the Galaxy S8-7 and 6, they're all good but just different dislays.




## Pros of owning a Galaxy
One of the good things of owning a Galaxy is the experience of using it. The experience of using it just feels good, like when you're super tired and you just want to drink a soda good.

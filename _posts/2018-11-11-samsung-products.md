## What Samsung is
Samsung is one of the biggest companies that produce technical products for a living. One of their most succesful products that they have sold is the Samsung Galaxy, the Samsung Galaxy is a type of phone that they make and trust me, their latest Galaxy (Galaxy S9) is a monster with speed and and the display of the thing is just amazing! I highly reccomend a Samsung Galaxy S9 but if you dont want to pay 1k for a phone, just buy one of their old ones like the Galaxy S8-7 and 6, they're all good but just different dislays.

## Pros of owning a Galaxy
One of the good things of owning a Galaxy is the experience of using it. The experience of using it just feels good, like when you're super tired and you just want to drink a soda good. Okay,one of the actual pors of owning one is that there are so many features in the phone that you can try out like the suoer sharp camera on their Galaxy 9 and the Note 9. Another one of the reasons to buy it is because of the amazing display that the phone has, the curved screen and hard glass, it is whatever you want in a phone.

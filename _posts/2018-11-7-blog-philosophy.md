The image right above is supposed to represent animation. Animation is a bunch of images or drawings to create a illusion of movement.If you watch stuff from Disney, you would know what animation is. The picture above was the only image I could find that was not copyrighted and close to animation. 


# The impact of Animation

Animation has a big impact on my life and probably yours too. The first obvious reason is that it has been seen at least once or twice in your lifetime. Animation is best represented in things such as cartoon and drawings or you can think of animation as stop motion. A reason to why animation and cartoons have been a big impact to my childhood is because it has always been there when I needed it, for example when I used to get bored I would put in the Disney cartoon vhs in the vhs player and I would just watch the cartoon because as a kid cartoon was the thing for me. 

# Cartoons I have Seen

There have been many cartoons I have seen as a kid and here are some that I have seen or you have seen. One of the movies that I have enjoyed so much as a kid was the cartoon "Monsters, Inc". This cartoon was so enjoyable for me was because of the cartoon monsters in the movie, obviously it wasn't just the monsters, it was the dialogue and plot of the movie that had me astounded. The plot of the movie followed two monsters that are best friends and also work in the same place, Monster Incorporations. But whilst they were working, they have found a human girl that had escaped from one of their portal doors. This leads to conflict between the two friends because one of them wants to keep the human girl and the other wants the little girl to go back. This is soon to be resolved by them dressing the little girl up as a monster but of course there is more conflict when the little girl goes missing. There is more to this movie than this plot but if you wanna watch it you can either buy the movie by going to the Disney website. Monsters, Inc is not the only cartoon that I have seen as a kid, i've seen other big titles like Robin Hood and others like Pinocchio and Lion King.

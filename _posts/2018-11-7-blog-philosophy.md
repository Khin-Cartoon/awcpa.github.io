# The Philosophy Behind Blogging
Almost every blog on the internet exists because its maker subscribes to these three philosophical ideals:
* Producing is better than consuming
* Links and comments create communities
* Your voice can't be heard in a vacuum

Most importantly, it's true that you're voice can't be heard in a vacuum. To grow your site on the internet you need to connect with others.

# Influencers 

Finally -- think about this. If you're doing your daily work, connecting it with others in your community, taking care of yourself and the writers in your group, then your influence will grow. This is how you bring your ideas or your products to the world. It might sound cliche, but it's true...

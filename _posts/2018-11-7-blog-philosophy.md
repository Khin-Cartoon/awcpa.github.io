# The Philosophy Behind Blogging
Almost every blog on the internet exists because its maker subscribes to these three philosophical ideals:
* Producing is better than consuming
* Links and comments create communities
* Your voice can't be heard in a vacuum

If you're wondering what the big deal is about blogs, read on...

# Be a producer, not a consumer

*photographers are makers -- how 'bout you?*

One of the most important lifestyle changes you can make is to dedicate yourself to being a producer instead of a consumer. As articles like this one at [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/5887345/start-every-day-as-a-producer-not-a-consumer) or this one at [HackTheEntrepreneur](https://hacktheentrepreneur.com/consumer-to-producer/) show, making instead of consuming is the fastest way for you to find true financial freedom. 

Adam Cave at Medium's ["A Startup"](https://medium.com/swlh/consumer-vs-producer-a-change-in-mindset-that-will-change-your-life-11cf8092e3e6) Blog says it well:  

> Producers, on the other hand, strive to make something valuable to others. They receive their payment not only monetarily, but through the confidence of self that they donâ€™t require anyone else to survive in this world.

# Make Links

*creating or joining a community feels great*

Creating [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) is the fastest way to link up with other like mined creators, learn more, and enjoy the benifits of being a part of a community. When you're writing, think about the people who have shaped your ideas and then show them some love by including their work in a [link--shout out to Eric Kim!](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/).

Most importantly, it's true that you're voice can't be heard in a vacuum. To grow your site on the internet you need to connect with others.

# Influencers 

Finally -- think about this. If you're doing your daily work, connecting it with others in your community, taking care of yourself and the writers in your group, then your influence will grow. This is how you bring your ideas or your products to the world. It might sound cliche, but it's true that
> A journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.

So, dedicate yourself to doing what you love every day, and create a daily making routing. If you love to write, wake up and journal. If you are an artist, make time every day to practice. If you want to help others volunteer, if you want to be a vet chart your course, focus on the classes you need in high school and college, and apply yourself. If you're bored, motivate yourself by looking closely at the options you have now and think about where your choices today might take you in the future. 

In other words, if you're bored, you're not paying close enough attention to what's going on around you. Don't sell your potential short and don't give in to sloth and torpor (laziness). You can generate the energy you need to be the best at what you want to do -- so get busy.

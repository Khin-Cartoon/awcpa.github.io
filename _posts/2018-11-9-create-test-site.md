## CGI Animation


This type of animation is mostly seen in Disney movies like Moana, Frozen and many other Disney cartoons.
If you don't know what CGI is, it stands for Computer Gateway Interface or you wanna keep it simple, 3D animation.
The cost of this thing in movies is crazy expensive, from 50 USD an hour per person and 80k for a shot.
If a movie uses 10 minutes of CGI, the total price of the CGI would be equal to 800k USD.
Big movie and cartoon businesses use this in their movies.
In my opinion, CGI is a useful thing in movies but for the price of it, it's a nono for me.  




## Drawn Animation

This type of animation is the most common and is less expensive than cgi animation.This type of animation has been
around and been used for a very long time, like in the 1900s. If you have watched movies/cartoons like old disney movies, you would know what drawn animation looks like when played. To me, drawn animation is the best form of animation because when using cgi, the cost of it is just so expensive and when using drawn animation,the budget is much less because it is all drawn and not cgi'd.
